I have Read chapters 4-6, 7-9 of "Software Quality Engineering".
In these chapters,I know something about defect handling and how different QA activities fit into different software processes. I also know  QA activities from the perspective of verification and validation (V&V), and how  to reconcile this V&V view with the view of QA as different ways of dealing with defects. Through these chapters I have a more clear perspect of the whole process of quality engineering. I realised the importance of testing and know how to test to ensure software quality.
