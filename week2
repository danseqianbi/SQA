###Summary###
I have Read chapters 4-6, 7-9 of "Software Quality Engineering".
In these chapters,I know something about defect handling and how different QA activities 
fit into different software processes. I also know  QA activities from the perspective of
verification and validation (V&V), and how  to reconcile this V&V view with the view
of QA as different ways of dealing with defects. Through these chapters
I have a more clear perspect of the whole process of quality engineering. 
I realised the importance of testing and know how to test to ensure software quality.
There are many approaches to software testing. Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are referred to as static testing, whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing. Static testing involves verification, whereas dynamic testing involves validation. Together they help improve software quality. Among the techniques for static analysis, mutation testing can be used to ensure the test-cases will detect errors which are introduced by mutating the source code.
